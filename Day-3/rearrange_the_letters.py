Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters of one to spell the second.  
For example, the following words are anagrams:

 ['abets', 'baste', 'bates', 'beast', 'beats', 'betas', 'tabes']

Hint: How can you tell quickly if two words are anagrams?  
Dictionaries allow you to find a key quickly.
